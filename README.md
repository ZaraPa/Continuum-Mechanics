# The Piola-Kirchhoff Stress and The Elasticity Tensor
###### Continuum-Mechanics (104191, Technion) - Final Project

<p align="justify">
The project shows and proofs the Piola-Kirchhoff Stress a.k.a. first Piola-Kirchhoff Stress, using stress tensor insted of Cauchy stress tensor (T). The explanation of the preference - The Cauchy stress tensor measures in the deformed configuration (i.e. the deformed configuration is unknown) and the stress tensor measures at the reference configuration (i.e. before the deformation). 

Along witht that, the project presents the elasticity tensor.
